This app takes a csv file with the names of geographic locations or demographic
groups, the sq milage and population estimates respectively, and allows
the user to compare them.

Use cases:
- I want to know what US state Kern County is closest to in size. The answer is South Dakota.
- I want to know what US state Los Angeles County is closest to in population. The answer is Michigan.

Future features:
- Build a gui to allow me to type the name of a county into a box and have the program return the comparisons 
as full sentences I can copy-paste into my manuscript.
